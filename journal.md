A rundown of my experience this week, divided up by sections on the instructions page.
## Listen
I will be honest. I'm not a fan of podcasts. I find it very easy to zone-out without a visual component. Even if I have no distractions around me there's always my own head. But I got through it after a few rewinds.
## Read
*Hypothes.is?? Zotero?? Ah! I haven't made those accounts yet!*

I was not entirely used to this course having things that didn't need to be done in the exact order they were presented. I really wanted to go through the instructions like a checklist. But alas, I needed to create my accounts and come back to do the readings so I could make use of the software. But once I did, I was quite delighted, especially with Hypothesis. It makes the whole internet feel like one big Google Doc we can all comment on, which is pretty cool. I feel like I could make use of this in my personal life even, perhaps as some kind of additional way to connect with friends during the quarantine...I'm just not exactly sure how yet. Zotero will also be helpful in situations outside of this class I think. Gone are my days of keeping dozens of tabs open for the entire duration of an assignment!
## Do
Setting up all my accounts went smoothly. Github was definitely the most intimidating. There's an overwheming amount of terminology that I will probably never need to know for this course but I want to know what it all MEANS! But I don't even know where to start. 

I usually approach things with a "I can do anything if I just have the instructions!" mindset, so I wanted to try making a scholarly website as described at the end of the Github page. But I got a bit overwhelmed despite the instructions so I might try that again later in the course. 

That stackoverflow thread on the Asking For Help page was also...a lot. It took me a second just to figure out what it meant when something was highlighted in grey. The question seemed straightforward enough but I had NO idea what the answers were getting at. Even the first step of the first answer, "create the remote repository" the WHAT? Who said anything about remote repositories? I thought we were just trying to upload code onto Github...Good thing we don't need to use that site.
