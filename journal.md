A rundown of my experience this week, divided up by sections on the instructions page.
## Listen
I will be honest. I'm not a fan of podcasts. I find it very easy to zone-out without a visual component. Even if I have no distractions around me there's always my own head. But I got through it after a few rewinds.
## Read
*Hypothes.is?? Zotero?? Ah! I haven't made those accounts yet!*

I was not entirely used to this course having things that didn't need to be done in the exact order they were presented. I really wanted to go through the instructions like a checklist. But alas, I needed to create my accounts and THEN come back to do the readings so I could make use of the software. But once I did, I was quite delighted, especially with Hypothesis. It makes the entire internet feel like one big Google Doc we can all comment on, which is pretty cool. I feel like I could make use of this in my personal life even, perhaps as some kind of additional way to connect with friends during the quarantine...I'm just not exactly sure how yet. Zotero will also be helpful in situations outside of this class I think. Gone are my days of keeping dozens of tabs open for the entire duration of an assignment!

RE: the actual readings. The article about women and digital history might have been a bit more meaningful to me if I were actually active in the field, and had heard of the people/projects mentioned. To me it was just kind of a list of things people were doing. But it was interesting and concerning how the work of women in certain institutions aren't properly credited since the credit goes to the insitution as a whole. The tweet thread included a tweet about the Digital Transgender Archive, which was the only one on the list that I had heard of, and finally gave me the motivation to actually check it out. I'd also never really thought that deeply about archival silences as a concept, which I now see as an important thing to consider. Archives aren't just a bunch of stuff. The omissions are meaningful as well. 
## Do
Setting up all my accounts went smoothly. Github was definitely the most intimidating. There's an overwheming amount of terminology that I will probably never need to know for this course but I want to know what it all MEANS! But I don't even know where to start. 

I usually approach things with a "I can do anything if I just have the instructions!" mindset, so I wanted to try making a scholarly website as described at the end of the Github instructions page, even though I have no prior experience with it. But I got a bit overwhelmed despite the instructions, so I might try that again later in the course. 

That Stackoverflow thread on the Asking For Help page was also...a lot. It took me a second just to figure out what it meant when something was highlighted in grey. The question seemed straightforward enough but I had NO idea what the answers were getting at. Even the first step of the first answer, "create the remote repository" the WHAT? Who said anything about remote repositories? I thought we were just trying to upload code onto Github...Good thing we don't need to use Stackoverflow for this class.

## Digital History in general
I didn't really have much of an idea of what digital history was to begin with, and I didn't really care to think much about it prior to the start of the course if I'm being honest. I just wanted to find out once I got started. So I didn't have much in terms of expectations. And I'm still not sure I know EXACTLY what DH encompasses. Regardless, I'm excited to learn how to use new technology, and I remain fearless amidst the promise of step-by-step instructions.
